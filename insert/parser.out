Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

insertoption         : 
statement            : 0
valuelist            : 2

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . statement
    (1) statement -> . INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME

    INSERT          shift and go to state 2

    statement                      shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> statement .



state 2

    (1) statement -> INSERT . INTO TABLE_NAME

    INTO            shift and go to state 3


state 3

    (1) statement -> INSERT INTO . TABLE_NAME

    TABLE_NAME      shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (1) statement -> INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (statement -> INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME .)
